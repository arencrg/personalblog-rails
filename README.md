# Personal Blog on Rails

This is my first attempt at creating a blog with Rails. I've been absent for class for around 3ish days so I've been trying to catch up whenever my head isn't being squished inside my own skull. I've been able to catch up quite fast even tho I sometimes feel like I'm still trying to get a feel of things. Baby steps, as always. 

(20 Jul 2017) I've only managed to design the landing page. The other pages are all bare, but I plan to finish all the designs within the week.
